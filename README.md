# **AI Fraud Detection System - Cassata Coder (NiramUNthon 6.0)**  

🚀 **Cassata Coder's AI Fraud Detection System** was developed during **NiramUNthon 6.0** to enhance financial security through real-time fraud analysis. This system intelligently detects fraudulent transactions using machine learning and automated verification.  

## **🔍 Key Features**  
- **Real-time Fraud Detection:** Analyzes transactions as they happen using a **real-time database**.  
- **Three AI Agents:**
  1. **Anomaly Detection** – Identifies unusual transactions using **Isolation Forest (self-learning algorithm)**.  
  2. **Pattern Recognition** – Detects fraudulent transaction patterns using a custom **pattern detection algorithm**.  
  3. **Identity Verification** – Ensures transaction authenticity via **OTP-based email verification**.  
- **Fraud Flag System:** Uses **if-else logic** and **machine learning models** to determine fraud risks based on **account age, transaction count, and amount**.  
- **Revoked vs. Verified Transactions:** If a fraud flag is raised, the sender must enter an OTP. Failure results in a **revoked transaction**, while successful OTP verification marks it as **verified**.  

## **🛠️ Technologies Used**  
### **Backend (AI & API)**  
- 🐍 Python – AI models for anomaly detection, pattern recognition, and identity verification.  
- 🔥 Flask – API for connecting frontend with backend.  
- 🏦 SQL Server – Stores and fetches real-time transaction data.  
- 🌲 Isolation Forest Algorithm – Self-learning model for fraud detection.  

### Frontend (User Interface)  
- 🌐 HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery – Responsive and interactive UI.  
- 🔐 Login & Registration Pages – Secure user authentication.  
- 📊 Fraud Detection Dashboard – Displays preprocessed transaction history and real-time fraud analysis.  

## 📌 How It Works
1. A transaction is initiated and sent to the **AI fraud detection system**.  
2. AI models analyze the transaction based on account age, transaction count, and amount.  
3. If a fraud flag is raised:  
   - An OTP is sent to the sender’s email.  
   - If OTP is not provided, the transaction is **revoked**.  
   - If OTP is verified, the transaction is **approved**.  
4. All transactions (normal, flagged, and revoked) are displayed on the dashboard.  

💡 This project showcases the power of **AI-driven fraud detection** and real-time user verification to create **safer digital transactions**!
